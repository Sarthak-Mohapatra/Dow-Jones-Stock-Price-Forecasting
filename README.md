## Stock Price Forecasting of Dow Jones 30 companies (DJIA) - (2000-01-01 to 2020-25-05)

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is a famous and widely referenced stock market indicator. It started in the year 1885 and is the second oldest active market index.
Currently, 30 different companies make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It covers almost all major US markets except for transportation and utilities. It initially started with just 12 companies.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is very different. The DJIA is a "price-weighted" index, meaning that the companies with higher stock prices have greater weight in the index's calculation. But the DJIA isn't just the sum of the stock prices of the 30 stocks: It's a scaled average, meaning that the index's value is adjusted to account for historic stock splits, dividends, and other changes to the individual stocks over time.
